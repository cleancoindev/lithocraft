Is Minecraft terrain too "samey" for you? You have the fractal-based
terrain generation algorithms to thank for that! There just enough
unique variety to keep the human eye pleased.

Eventually, this project aims to achieve the lofty goal of
realistic(ish) terrain generation for Minecraft by using principles
from plate tectonics, a simplified climate and weather
model, and eventually a history simulator. The world will feel alive,
spontaneous and natural, instead of noisy and random looking.

Climate modeling and plate tectonics are a "global"-scale phenomena,
and will require clever integration to make work with Minecraft's
infinte terrain generation. I plan to develop algorithms with smooth
boundary transitions, but then run these simulations on many chunks at
once (64x64 chunks).

This is a very Work-In-Progress project, but stay tuned.

algorithms in your own games)
